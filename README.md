# SpringMVCDemo

<BR>
This is basic Spring MVC Module Demo. Once imported this code, you can run the application using Apache Tomcat and access the path <br>
http://localhost:8080/SpringMVCDemo/

<br>
For more details, see the code or the request paths in the controller classes which are annotated with @Controller. (Eg: WelcomeController)
